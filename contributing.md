## Foreword

Welcome to the fan-made Live A Hero Wiki! It is still work in progress, so thanks for considering to contribute
this project.

The owner of this wiki is currently focusing on laying out the fundamentals of this websites and writing contributing guides
so that more people can start contributing (we need content writers!). Design is less of a priority now, we promise we will
get back to the website design later when we have enough active contributors.

## How to contribute

For all potential wiki contributors, you must create a Github account beforehand (free plan is enough).
If this is hosted with MediaWiki, we would have ask you to create wiki account as well, so please don't
be discouraged by the need to create a new account.

### Edit a page

Every page should have a "Edit this page" link on top. It will lead you to the edit page in Github. The interface
should be pretty intuitive to use.

Most pages are written in Markdown syntax. Please see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Please feel free to fix typos and phrasings.

## More instructions on specific task

### Create page for new Hero `/heroes/:name/`

1. Under `_heroes/` directory, [create a new `name.md` file](https://github.com/liveahero-wiki/liveahero-wiki.github.io/new/master/_heroes). `name` should be lowercase of English name in official trailer (e.g. `akashi`).
2. Copy the content of [akashi's page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liveahero-wiki/liveahero-wiki.github.io/master/_heroes/akashi.md) into this file and edit accordingly.
